Strange, but I see wacko Bernie Sanders allies coming over to me because I'm lowering taxes, while he will double & triple them, a disaster!	12/28/15 8:34	9891	4021	6.81468E+017
Wages in are country are too low, good jobs are too few,  and people have lost faith in our leaders.We need smart and strong leadership now!	12/28/15 7:50	9941	3685	6.81457E+017

John Kasich was managing director of Lehman Brothers when it crashed, bringing down the world and ruining people's lives. A total failure!	11/19/15 20:55	3783	1694	6.67522E+017
Once John Kasich announced he was running for president, and opened his mouth, people realized he was a complete & total dud!	11/19/15 20:47	4116	1499	6.6752E+017
John Kasich fell right into President Obama�۪s trap on ObamaCare, and the people of Ohio are suffering for it. Shame!	11/19/15 20:06	3776	1517	6.67509E+017
Doesn�۪t help Kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else  - he�۪s almost last.	11/19/15 20:06	3139	1148	6.67509E+017
John Kasich ad guy wanted to work for me, but his proposal was a rip off ��� I said NO! Now ripping Kasich.	11/19/15 20:06	2858	1066	6.67509E+017
I loved beating John Kasich in the debates, but it was easy���he came in dead last!	11/19/15 20:06	3283	1191	6.67509E+017
Kasich has already spent $6 million on ads in New Hampshire and his numbers have gone down. People from NH are smart!	11/19/15 20:06	3727	1275	6.67509E+017
Watch Kasich squirm --- if he is not truthful in his negative ads I will sue him just for fun!	11/19/15 20:06	4355	1909	6.67509E+017
I want to do negative ads on John Kasich, but he is so irrelevant to the race that I don�۪t want to waste my money.	11/19/15 20:05	6652	3055	6.67509E+017
John Kasich, despite being Governor of Ohio, is losing to me in the Ohio polls. Pathetic!	11/19/15 20:05	3665	1456	6.67509E+017
John Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image, not negative ads on me.	11/19/15 20:05	2786	1095	6.67509E+017
Governor Kasich, whose failed campaign & debating skills have brought him way down in the polls, is going to spend $2.5 million against me.	11/19/15 20:04	2485	1055	6.67509E+017

Who is the moron who decided to release the Ferguson grand jury findings after 9:00 o'clock in the evening. What were they thinking?	11/25/14 3:35	1581	1118	5.37163E+017
Our country is totally fractured and, with our weak leadership in Washington, you can expect Ferguson type riots and looting in other places	11/25/14 3:25	731	608	5.3716E+017
Sadly, because president Obama has done such a poor job as president, you won't see another black president for generations!	11/25/14 3:15	17301	15782	5.37158E+017
As China and the rest of the World continue to rip off the U.S. economically, they laugh at us and our president over the riots in Ferguson!	11/25/14 3:07	590	513	5.37156E+017
Can you imagine what Putin and all of our friends and enemies throughout the world are saying about the U.S. as they watch the Ferguson riot	11/25/14 2:57	808	698	5.37153E+017
If the decision by the grand jury in Ferguson was the exact opposite, you would still be having the riots right now!	11/25/14 2:45	929	714	5.3715E+017
Despite having a black president, the racial divide seems greater than it has in decades.If Obama were a  leader, this would not be the case	11/24/14 22:47	5488	4550	5.3709E+017

Why would they announce a finding of the grand jury in Ferguson at 9:00 in the evening - a prime time for riots! Not smart.	11/24/14 18:51	1209	909	5.37031E+017
Iran and the United States just pushed deadline back SEVEN MONTHS on working out a nuclear deal. Iran is tapping along our bad negotiators!	11/24/14 18:47	136	84	5.3703E+017
ISIS is starting its own currency. May be stronger than the dollar if ObamaCare is fully implemented.	11/24/14 16:38	1433	1327	5.36997E+017
There is no excuse for riots in Ferguson regardless of the grand jury outcome.	11/24/14 16:30	1318	862	5.36995E+017
Fact ��� Amnesty lowers wages and invites more lawlessness. Obama has unilaterally cancelled any chance of immigration reform.	11/24/14 15:48	317	262	5.36985E+017

I love @LibertyUniversity--such great people!	10/15/12 10:10	123	255	2.57846E+017
A-Rod is just not making it. We want to give him a chance but it was only drugs that made him great.	10/15/12 9:54	71	469	2.57842E+017
I feel guilty not having attended the last two @yankees games (losses).  They would have won!	10/15/12 9:53	33	84	2.57842E+017
Obama will be trying very hard at next debate- he doesn't want to lose the Boeing.	10/14/12 22:24	112	371	2.57668E+017
Who says Obama will do better in the next debate- has he gotten smarter in 2 weeks!	10/14/12 22:06	216	817	2.57664E+017
.@MittRomney's poll numbers are looking really good. One more great debate performance and it will be a total knockout.��	10/14/12 21:40	207	684	2.57657E+017
I have never seen a thin person drinking  Diet Coke.	10/14/12 14:43	53158	51978	2.57552E+017
No, I wasn't at the @Yankees game yesterday- can't go today either. When I go, they win.	10/14/12 14:43	36	103	2.57552E+017

Yankees can win today. Kuroda is a highly underrated pitcher.	10/14/12 12:44	18	74	2.57522E+017
A-Rod hit ball hard first at bat. Time for him to step up and leave.	10/14/12 12:42	9	53	2.57522E+017
Swisher should have caught ball in right field last night.	10/14/12 10:09	15	90	2.57483E+017
.@Yankees are in trouble without Derek. Try A-Rod at short- get him some confidence.	10/14/12 9:39	33	125	2.57476E+017
A bad thing finally happened to Derek Jeter--- he is a great champion.	10/14/12 9:09	40	129	2.57468E+017
So much for Washington shutting down Strasburg- they deserved to lose.	10/13/12 21:34	56	196	2.57293E+017
Roadway steel on beautiful Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is rusting and rotting away. Scrape and paint before too late.	10/13/12 17:11	15	53	2.57227E+017
Tonight, despite everything, put A-Rod in the lineup.��	10/13/12 14:58	4	15	2.57194E+017
Everyone's wondering what's wrong with A-Rod. Not one sports writer blames it on his not being able to use drugs anymore-- the real reason.��	10/13/12 14:40	109	683	2.57189E+017
They found Jessica in Colorado--- body was mutilated--- death to the pervert killer.	10/13/12 13:38	143	411	2.57173E+017
Joe Girardi did a great job of managing the Yankees this series.	10/13/12 11:38	26	110	2.57143E+017
I'll bet Obama goes down just like Washington because he doesn't use our(this country's) best people to win.	10/13/12 11:28	64	214	2.57141E+017
Washington should have brought in Strasburg to relieve-- they would have won.	10/13/12 11:13	21	119	2.57137E+017
When Strasburg leaves in a couple of years under free agency Washington will say " what were we doing".	10/13/12 10:14	78	377	2.57122E+017
I told you, whenever I go to a @Yankees game the @Yankees win.	10/12/12 20:22	123	344	2.56913E+017

Pretty even debate- no knockouts. However Ryan's closing statement somewhat stronger. What do you think? #VPDebate	10/11/12 22:39	198	527	2.56585E+017
Biden's statements on Medicare are very effective. Ryan must now come back and combat. #VPDebate	10/11/12 21:47	67	432	2.56572E+017
Excellent story on @MittRomney- very good moment for Ryan. #VPDebate	10/11/12 21:29	228	604	2.56567E+017
Pretty even debate but don't force Obama into a war--- he would be the wrong leader. #VPDebate	10/11/12 21:25	66	217	2.56566E+017
Biden's sarcastic smiling may or may not be effective depending on who is watching. #VPDebate	10/11/12 21:24	176	704	2.56566E+017
Hard for Biden to justify Libya mess but doing best he can. #VPDebate	10/11/12 21:13	58	237	2.56563E+017
Both candidates are looking sharp- now it's up to the mouth and the mind. #VPDebate	10/11/12 21:04	46	210	2.56561E+017

Why the hell did we help the Libyan "rebels" in the first place. That is the real scandal.	10/11/12 15:31	83	204	2.56477E+017

Amazing that Derek Jeter played with an injury throughout most of last night's @yankees game and did so well.	10/11/12 12:55	18	62	2.56438E+017
$30M a year and A-Rod is now relegated to the bench. @yankees would have lost if Girardi hadn't benched him in the 9th (see my prediction)	10/11/12 12:38	19	85	2.56434E+017

Asking why my dislike of A-Rod--dishonorable dealings with me on an apartment deal	10/11/12 11:51	30	178	2.56422E+017
Great move to take A-Rod out of game. Now terminate his contract based on misrepresentation (drugs).	10/11/12 11:45	38	217	2.5642E+017

47M on food stamps. Over 23M Americans unemployed. 50% of college grads unemployed. And Obama wants us talking about Big Bird.	10/10/12 14:49	312	1891	2.56104E+017
